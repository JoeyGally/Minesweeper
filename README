It was made in chrome.
Safari works, although the styling is a little funny.
Other browsers are unknown. If there's a problem, make an issue about it and I'll see if I can fix it.

If you don't have internet access, you'll have to use the file in the Offline-Mode folder, as it uses a local copy of the jQuery library.



How to Play:

To start a new game, press the button that says new game.
It will prompt you on how big you want the board to be.
Then, you are prompted for the number of mines. Any number from 1 to 1 less than the number of squares is valid.
Warning! Larger board sizes and smaller numbers of mines can cause lag, and may even crash the program.

Once the game starts:
Left click to test a square. If it's a mine, you lose.
If it's safe, it tells you how many mines it's touching, from 1 to 8.
If it touches no mines, the entire region of no mines will be revealed.

Press shift while hovering over a square to flag it.
Press shift again to make it a question mark.
Press shift again to reset it.

Press Q and R to change game mode to quick-start or regular.
Press N to start a new game.

Find all the mines to win!*
*This is actually how the program tests whether you've won. You have to mark all of the flags.
